Algorithm

# Input:

Read an integer n from input, representing the number of sets.
Read n sets of bits (bitsets) into an array B.

# Intersection Count:

Iterate over all pairs of sets (bitsets) in the array B.
For each pair (B[i], B[j]) where i < j, calculate the number of bits set to 1 in the intersection of the two sets using the count() method of std::bitset.
Store this count in variable x.

# Pair Count Calculation:

For each x, add (x * (x - 1)) to the answer ans. This represents the number of ways to choose two elements from a set of size x. It's calculated as (x choose 2) = x! / (2! * (x - 2)!).
By iterating over all pairs of sets, this code accumulates the total number of pairs that meet the criteria.

# Output:

Finally, output ans / 2. Since each pair (B[i], B[j]) is counted twice (once for (B[i], B[j]) and once for (B[j], B[i])), the answer is halved to avoid double-counting.
Optimization:

The code uses the popcnt instruction to optimize bit counting. This instruction calculates the number of set bits in an integer in a single CPU instruction, which can lead to performance improvements.
