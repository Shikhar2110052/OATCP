Algorithm 

#The provided algorithm aims to generate short forms for a set of dictionary words by considering all possible subsequences 
#of length one to four characters from each word. It achieves this by recursively generating subsequences using the function gen_subs. 
#The function recursively explores two options at each step: including the current character in the subsequence or excluding it. 
#The recursion stops when the desired subsequence length is reached or when the end of the word is reached. 
#To optimize and avoid duplicate short forms, a set short_forms is used to store unique short forms encountered so far. 
#For each word in the dictionary, the algorithm generates short forms and adds them to a 2D vector ans. Finally, it prints the short forms for each word in ans. 
#This algorithm efficiently explores all possible subsequences to generate unique short forms for each word in the dictionary, 
ensuring that no duplicate short forms are included in the output.
